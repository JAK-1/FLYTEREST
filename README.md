# FLYTEREST

the obstacle avoidance code is built using an arduino and 5 ultrasonic sensors. One sensor faces down and as soon as the drone is higher than 1.5m in altitude, the whole system is activated. The other sensros are faced out in the 4 directions and will proper the drone away from the obstacles.

pin(2,3): left
pin(4,5): back
pin(6,7): right
pin(8,9): front
pin(10,11): down

This has a range of about 100cm, 
if you want something greater than that you need to use a strong IR sensor, or a more powerful LIDAR senor, you can even map with that. Going to build that very soon.
